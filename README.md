Fresh Fields - Farmers portal

In today’s world, or any item to reach from the farmer to the consumer involves a lot of steps and middlemen which can cause the process to slow down and also cause hoarding of prices where only the farmer and consumer are at a loss.
Hoarding of the agricultural production leads to a hike in the price of the crop/end product. Hence, there is a need for a platform that will help the authorities keep a track of the trade, and take down any such hoarding practices being performed at any stage.
Our Idea was to create such a platform for the farmers connecting them directly to the consumers and workers thus expanding their business. This platform will allow these stakeholders to interact with each other and will facilitate the hiring of labor and purchase and sale of raw materials and produce respectively. Fresh Fields enables farmers to sell their products online. We provide technology and services to the farmers, merchants, and farm laborers, thus providing them with a wider great experience with an easy-to-use application.

Farmers can sell their produce online which can be purchased by wholesalers and retailers, and can also purchase farming products.
• There are three types of users: farmers, wholesalers/retailers/consumer and workers. The login ID and password is required to login to the system.
• The articles and statistics sections help farmers to gain knowledge.
• It has a history section which help the farmers keep a track of their uploaded produce and the customer to view the produce he/she has bought.
• It also helps the farm laborer’s in finding jobs.

The scope of this application currently includes all the cities and districts present in the state of Maharashtra
